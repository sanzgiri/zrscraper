# Changelog

## [Fixed] - 2025-11-01

### Problem
The GitHub Action workflow was failing since July 2023 due to Zillow website structure changes. The scraper was unable to find the Zestimate value using the old XPath selector, resulting in `NaN` values in the data.csv file, which caused the workflow validation to fail.

### Root Cause
- Zillow redesigned their website and removed/changed the HTML structure where the Zestimate was displayed
- The old XPath selector `//button[contains(text(), 'Zestimate')]/parent::node()//span[contains(text(), '$')]/text()` no longer worked
- The website now shows property data in a different format, with key information stored in meta tags

### Solution
1. **Inspected Zillow's Current HTML Structure**
   - Downloaded and analyzed the current Zillow property page
   - Found that Zestimate data is now embedded in the `og:description` meta tag

2. **Updated XPath Selector**
   - Changed from: `//button[contains(text(), 'Zestimate')]/parent::node()//span[contains(text(), '$')]/text()`
   - Changed to: `//meta[@property='og:description']/@content`
   - Added regex extraction pattern: `Zestimate for this (?:Single Family|home|property) is \$([0-9,]+)`

3. **Created Custom Scraper**
   - Built `scrape_with_premium.py` to replace the `real-estate-scrape` package
   - Added support for premium ScraperAPI parameter for Zillow
   - Added regex pattern matching for extracting values from meta descriptions

4. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Changed from installing `real-estate-scrape` package to using custom script
   - Updated dependencies to only install required packages: `lxml matplotlib pandas requests`
   - Workflow now runs `python scrape_with_premium.py` instead of `real-estate-scrape`

### Results
- ✅ Redfin scraping: Working (value: $1,188,214)
- ✅ Zillow scraping: Fixed (value: $1,305,400)
- ✅ No more NaN values in data.csv
- ✅ GitHub Action validation passes

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/real-estate-scrape.yml` - Updated workflow to use custom scraper
- `scrape_with_premium.py` - New custom scraper with updated Zillow XPath
- `data.csv` - Cleared old data from previous property (pre-2023)

### Technical Details
- **Redfin XPath**: `//div[@class='statsValue price'][1]//text()` (unchanged)
- **Zillow XPath**: `//meta[@property='og:description']/@content` (new)
- **Zillow Extract Pattern**: `Zestimate for this (?:Single Family|home|property) is \$([0-9,]+)` (new)
- **ScraperAPI Premium**: Enabled for Zillow requests
